6. About (Short Description / Summary): We  design  and implement  an  embedded   surveillance  system by the use of  Pyroelectric  Infrared  sensors  (PIR) to  detect  an  intruder in  a secured place. 
 The PIR sensors are placed on the ceiling  and it is used to detect human temperature .The web camera captures the image and send it to the android mobile. A security system that interfaces with an Android mobile device is developed. 
The android  mobile device and security system communicate via Bluetooth because a short-range-only communications system was desired. This application can be loaded onto any compatible device such as android mobile and tablets . 
Once  it is loaded it interfaces  with the security system. Commands to lock, unlock, or check the status of the door to which the security system is installed can be sent quickly from the android  mobile device. 
The security system then acts on these commands, taking the appropriate action and sending a confirmation back to the android  mobile device.
7. Install (Installation procedure): 
Step 1: Install VMWare workstation for virtually creating Windows XP.
Step 2:Install Eclipse (helios) software to enable android in the device(prefered).
Step 3: Install Tomcat version 5.5 (to connect both front end and back end).
Step 4: Start tomcat.
Step 5: Android codings are executed by the option "Run as Android Application".
8. Usage (add instruction on how to use the app, or you can redirect to
External link if you have one):-we can use this application for areas which need high security and also it can be implemented for home security
